    "description": "I have never written a single word praising the Bangladesh Army before. But this time I feel compelled to acknowledge the role of General Waker Uz Zaman, chief of army staff of the Bangladesh Army. During the 13th National Election, at a time of deep political tension and uncertainty, the army played a crucial role in maintaining order so that citizens could cast their invaluable votes. Ensuring a stable environment during elections is not a small responsibility. For that contribution, General Waker Uz Zaman deserves appreciation. However, we must also speak honestly about the violence and attacks that took place in recent months, including the attacks on media outlets and the unrest that followed the events of August 5. In my view, many of these incidents could have been prevented. The Bangladesh Army clearly has the capacity and discipline to control such situations when properly instructed. If the government had given firm and clear directives, much of the violence and the attacks on the media could have been stopped before they escalated. But the government did not issue such instructions. Instead, it allowed these incidents to unfold. The failure to act decisively created space for chaos, fear, and damage to democratic institutions. The responsibility for that inaction lies with the government. When state authority chooses not to intervene, it becomes accountable for the consequences. We had high expectations from the interim government. Many hoped for stability, fairness, and protection of democratic values. Unfortunately, those minimum expectations were not fulfilled. The disappointment among citizens is real. In this volatile context, General Waker Uz Zaman could have taken advantage of the instability. In many countries, such moments have led to military takeovers. He had the institutional strength to move in that direction. But he did not. Instead, he refrained from seeking power and appeared committed to supporting a democratic transition rather than disrupting it. That restraint is significant. It reflects professionalism and respect for constitutional order. So while the government must be held responsible for its failures and inaction, General Waker Uz Zaman deserves appreciation for choosing stability over ambition. Thank you, General.",
